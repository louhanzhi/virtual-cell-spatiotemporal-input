# Insights, opportunities, and challenges provided by large cell atlases

## Abstract

The feld of single-cell biology is growing rapidly, generating large amounts of data from a variety of species, disease conditions, tissues, and organs. Coordinated eforts such as CZI CELLxGENE, HuBMAP, Broad Institute Single Cell Portal, and DISCO allow researchers to access large volumes of curated datasets, including more than just scRNA-seq data. These resources have created an opportunity to build and expand the computational biology ecosystem to develop tools necessary for data reuse and for extracting novel biological insights. We highlight achievements made so far, areas where further development is needed, and specifc challenges that need to be overcome.

## Introduction

Technological advances have enabled generation and collection of large volumes of data at the single-cell resolution [1]. For the most part, this is done by individual research groups, and to make these datasets more useful to the community, they need to be assembled into cell atlases. In the context of single-cell technologies, an atlas is a large collection of datasets that have been curated and made accessible through a web portal. In addition to making it easier to fnd datasets, atlases provide a coherent pipeline for data ingestion and processing, ensuring that datasets can be combined and leveraged to provide novel biological insights.

Today, there are thousands of single-cell datasets available, and building an atlas is a resource-intensive endeavor, requiring a large team of biologists and data scientists. Moreover, substantial infrastructure is needed, and to be useful to the community, it must be sustained and updated over time. Hence, cell atlases are backed by large organizations or supported by large-scale projects (Table 1).

Together, we have been involved in the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s efort to expand the ecosystem of computational methods that can support and exploit cell atlases in the context of the Data Insights program. Here, we present our shared experiences, and we discuss some of the issues involved in building and using a cell atlas (Fig. 1). We then go on to explore the possibilities enabled by cell atlases as well as the challenges that the community faces going forward.

## Data ingestion, access, and representation

A central goal for any scientifc resource is to make sure that it adheres to the FAIR principles [15], i.e., ensuring that data is fndable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. By serving as central repositories, cell atlases make it easier to fnd and access data. By making sure that data is uniformly processed and adheres to standard formats, it also becomes interoperable and reusable. Although straightforward in principle, the scale and complexity of a cell atlas make it difcult to achieve these goals.

## Data pre‑processing

For sequencing data to be useful, one must have access to the underlying reads, typically stored in fastq format [16]. In addition to the raw data, the various levels of processed data and metadata must also be ingested. Te frst step for the cell atlas is to carry out quality controls to ensure the integrity of the data. Tus, preprocessing is a key step that is often poorly documented and difcult to reproduce due to the use of diferent versions of software packages. Although preprocessing can improve the internal consistency, it does not prevent the emergence of discrepancies within and across atlases. A particular concern for cell atlases is batch efects, technical artifacts that emerge due to diferences in how the data was obtained and processed. Although batch efects can be reduced, they cannot be eliminated altogether. Fortunately, it is possible to detect and correct batch efects post hoc, provided that detailed information about the processing is available. As no repository will be able to span all conditions, populations, organisms, cells, and modalities of interest, maintaining this possibility is a key requirement for enabling meta-analyses.

## Data accessibility, interoperability, and reusability

By providing a portal where users can search for data, cell atlases greatly facilitate fnding datasets. Depending on the use case, diferent levels of processing will be desired. Only providing the raw data is not sufcient, and various levels of processing will be required by most users. However, tools for indexing, metadata standardization, and cross-cohort queries are in their infancy, and this limits the ability of users to identify suitable datasets [2, 17]. Although it is possible to fnd and access individual datasets through a web browser, anyone interested in analyzing a large number of datasets needs to have both programming skills and sufcient computational resources. Tis creates a barrier for many users, and an important area of research is to develop computational tools to facilitate access to large cell atlases. Another key aspect is to provide APIs for those users who are developing code for accessing the cell atlas. Tis includes adhering to standardized fle formats as well as catering for multiple programming languages. At the time of writing, both R and Python are widely used, and cell atlases need to support both to be useful. As with many other aspects of a cell atlas, these resources need to be updated over time as the computational ecosystem and use cases evolve.

## Metadata and ontologies

Metadata is crucial for researchers interested in re-analyzing existing datasets. Complete and well-curated metadata can transform a cell atlas from being a static reference to a dynamic hypothesis-generating tool, enabling a variety of stratifed analyses. For example, metadata capturing timepoints post-infection enables reconstruction of disease trajectories. On the other hand, missing or incomplete metadata could mislead data interpretation (e.g., in a human study, efects that are actually due to donor sex or age would erroneously be attributed to treatment). Tis issue has long been recognized, and in the past, there have been community eforts such as MIAME [18] to set common standards. For scRNAseq, metadata can be divided into three categories: sample, gene, and cell. Sample metadata includes information about donor, time of collection, storage, experimental processing, computational processing, etc. Gene metadata is relatively straightforward, at least for model organisms, where various annotations are mature and stable. Te most important aspect of cell metadata is its annotation, and this requires mapping data to a cell type ontology [19]. An example of a metadata scheme developed for single-cell analysis is matrix and metadata standards (MAMS [20]). Although reporting and adhering to technical standards is important, it is essential to couple this to the establishment of a culture where data generators recognize their responsibility in providing complete metadata.

Ontologies allow formal and structured operations to be carried out, and they are thus essential to contextualize the resource and facilitate interpretations. In particular, they enable automated processing and application of ML/AI methods. Te Cell Ontology [21] provides a standardized vocabulary to annotate cell types and states, which is vital for ensuring interoperability across datasets. Cell type annotation is a central step in the biological interpretation, yet it remains one of the most time-consuming tasks during the analysis. Te traditional approach is to frst identify marker genes for each cluster and then use the literature to determine which is the corresponding cell type or state. Several computational tools seek to assist with this process by comparing to previously annotated datasets [22, 23], and this has been highlighted as one of the main use cases of cell atlases. However, when aggregating datasets, it is often the case that they have not been annotated consistently, and assigning a consistent set of cell labels remains a major challenge. No universally accepted defnition of cell types exists; however, as our knowledge of cell biology and identities is ever improving, consequently, ontologies must remain fexible to accommodate the diversity of cell types, states, and conditions. In this regard, we think that tools for harmonizing and standardizing annotations, such as [23] and [24], as well as initiatives such as the HuBMAP Common Coordinate Framework, will play an essential role in improving data consistency and enhancing the utility of atlases across contexts.

Cross-species comparisons can be particularly challenging due to diferences not only in nomenclature but also in function. Tese analyses can be assisted by retaining gene/feature-level metadata and leveraging orthology-based information, and tools such as SAMap [25] can bridge gaps between diferent phyla by robustly reconstructing the latent manifolds. Te integration of disease data into atlases also presents its own set of difculties as disease-associated cells may acquire distinct cell states, requiring expanded annotations in the metadata. Moreover, when querying a “normal” atlas with disease-specifc data, researchers must account for the potential lack of representation or mismatch in cell types [26]. For instance, cancer cells often recapitulate developmental gene programs, meaning these cells may map to normal developmental stages rather than the typical “diseased” cell types.

## Extracting the most out of a cell atlas

Te immediate use of cell atlases is to provide a global overview of cell types and cell states for a given tissue, disease, organism, or condition. An inventory of the building blocks is of great scientifc value, and once generated, it serves as a springboard to address further biological questions. Te challenge for the research community is that there is a breadth of needs for accessing a cell atlas. For some researchers, it may be enough to access a web server that displays gene expression and cell clusters, while bespoke analysis access may require downloading cell atlases to a local computer or server.

## Data representation and subsampling

Te typical workfow when using a cell atlas requires a user to frst identify and download the relevant datasets. Given their size, already exceeding 1 TB using standard data structures, this can require signifcant bandwidth and be prohibitive to many research labs without high-memory computing resources. For most users, working with this data requires out-of-core processing, high-performance computing, and signifcant efort in data wrangling [27]. Consequently, there is an urgent need for methods for handling streaming data as well as lossless compression algorithms for single-cell data that signifcantly reduce memory footprint without compromising computational performance. New data structures for R/C /Python can reduce memory footprint by up to tenfold over standard sparse matrices with minimal cost to compute. Tis has been achieved through substantial eforts in handling memory limitations and enabling processing of large datasets through the adoption of disk-backed or pyramidal data formats. Examples include Zarr, Parquet, and TileDB.

One algorithmic approach for dealing with large datasets is to subsample. Subsampling can ease computation over diverse datasets and help reduce bias of highly represented signals, but may also compromise the unprecedented modeling power that comes with a dataset of this size. Issues include racial and gender bias in samples [28], over-representation of specifc cell types [29], opportunistic collection of rare samples [30], but the best approach depends on the scientifc goals of the study. Simple random subsampling does not address signal representation and can miss rare subpopulations [31, 32], and it is desirable to balance the tradeof between representing the true proportions of cell types and full extent of cell identities of rare cell types [33]. As cell atlases become more diverse across tissues and patient donors, subsampling will become more attractive. However, such summaries may impair our ability to tease out subtle and biologically relevant signals that only come with the massive statistical power ofered by large sample sizes [34]. We also envision that latent space representations will be highly useful for providing compact representation, but further research is required to understand their accuracy and limitations. One promising line of work is the “biosketching” approach [32], which enables efcient and structure-preserving summarization of large-scale single-cell data. Another complementary strategy involves the construction of metacells, as developed in a series of works aiming to create compact, less sparse representations that preserve essential transcriptional structure while reducing noise (e.g., [35, 36]). While these approaches may sacrifce single-cell resolution, they ofer potential advantages in terms of interpretability, robustness, and computational tractability.

## Data integration and meta‑analysis

To relate cell atlases with each other or with additional single-cell datasets, the research community relies on data integration tools [37]. Tese tools aim to identify joint lowdimensional representations of all the input data, with which further downstream analysis can be performed, e.g., joint clustering, cell type classifcation, and diferential abundance testing. In modern single-cell analysis, this data integration is often key for harmonizing distinct datasets, and it serves as an initial step for meta-analysis of single-cell datasets. Appropriate meta-analyses will not only have to consider corrected cell type labels, but also other statistical factors that remain challenging to deal with.

Issues such as confounding factors, nested structure of single cells measured within biological samples (i.e., repeated measures), and understanding hidden sources of variability all may be relevant. Ideally, cells are curated with sample-level information such as donor identity, sex, age, tissue, organism, developmental stage, technology, and disease. Some of these confounders are technical, and performing data integration over them will remove noise and increase salience of biological signals [38]. Others are biologically driven, and thus data integration would enable researchers to compare analogous cell states across tissue, diseases, and organisms. A useful data integration algorithm must account for all of these sources of information and allow users to retain or remove specifc variation relevant to their analyses. For instance, a comparison of T cells across tissues may emphasize tissue-specifc diferences (i.e., do not harmonize over tissue) to explain diferential heritability, while others look to nominate for shared efector phenotypes across diseases (i.e., do harmonize over tissue) for basket clinical trials [39]. Tese scenarios highlight that data integration is not a static tool to be applied prior to further analysis, but rather needs to be adaptable to the research question at hand. Tis introduces a new computational challenge, as current integration algorithms are designed with the idea that they are run once per analysis, and therefore are not necessarily optimized to an online dynamic query setting. Successful data integration algorithms must address these emerging complexities, and they must (1) scale to 10,000 s of confounder levels (corresponding to the number of donors), (2) account for all sources of technical and biological variation in a way that lets users select which to account for, (3) perform consistently across a wide variety of cell atlas queries, (4) be fast and fexible enough to integrate diverse queries on the fy, (5) provide views of their impact on data distortion and signal degradation in a manner that is easy for the user to interpret. Numerous methods for carrying out batch integration have been proposed in recent years, resulting in substantial progress in terms of performance, as demonstrated by independent benchmarks [37, 40, 41]. However, several challenges remain, and existing methods often struggle in more complex scenarios, e.g., involving diferent species [42], imbalanced datasets [43], or very large numbers of cells. As quantitative metrics of batch integration provide an incomplete view, evaluation of the fve criteria above will also require careful considerations based on the biological interpretations.

## Building cell atlases in context

An important use of cell atlases, beyond defning cell types and corresponding markers, is to explore how cellular and transcriptional landscapes are impacted by specifc disease/functional decline (e.g., disease states, reduced function), physiological/biological factors (e.g., age, sex/gender, ethnic/genetic background), or treatments (e.g., response to a drug) [44–46]. Indeed, important insights can be achieved by analyzing cell atlases in a context-aware fashion, both comparing how biologically relevant inputs can lead to changes in (i) cell composition [47–49] and (ii) cell-type specifc gene expression. Importantly, even for single-cell atlases, biological replicates should consist of samples procured from independent biological sources/individuals, and not just independent cells from the same sample [50–52]. Tus, a key feature of context-aware cell atlases is the inclusion of sufcient independent biological samples across conditions to account for inter-individual variability. Tis requires sufcient numbers of true biological replicates, similar to bulk approaches [53]. For the interpretation of context-dependent cell atlases, it is crucial to consider the need for approaches that limit the high false positive rates in single-cell diferential analyses (e.g., considering the potential of pseudobulking approaches per identifed cell type/state to avoid underestimation of true biological variability [50, 51]). As an example, in the study of menopause and its potential molecular drivers, a context-aware atlas should include sufcient samples covering both pre-menopausal and post-menopausal states, in tissues most relevant to the condition (e.g., ovary, pituitary gland, hypothalamus) [54].

## Benchmarking and development of novel methods

Tere is currently a rapidly expanding ecosystem of computational tools in the singlecell feld, and for most problems, there is more than one method available. To help researchers decide what tool to choose, benchmarking studies are essential, and multiple benchmarking papers are published every month. Several challenges exist in the current single-cell benchmarking feld, and guidelines on best practices are needed. It needs to be clear what the evaluation metrics are, and although many details will depend on the specifc topic, there are overarching trends [55]. One of the main challenges when comparing methods is that for most problems, we do not have an independent ground truth. Hence, evaluating the performance will involve some degree of subjectivity. One way of circumventing this challenge is to use simulations to create synthetic data. However, most synthetic datasets are unable to capture the full spectrum of complexities found in real datasets, and more work is required to build on recent developments [56]. Comparisons using real datasets require curation, a process that can be time-consuming and requires substantial domain knowledge. Moreover, it may further entrench any value of certain algorithms through the process of performing the curation (e.g., clustering algorithms). As such, there is tremendous value in datasets that can be considered as a “gold standard” by virtue of orthogonal means. Carefully curated cell atlases can serve an important role here by being commonly used for benchmarking specifc analytical tasks.

Today, most analysis tools and strategies are designed within the context of a smaller number of datasets or total cells. Many methods that are commonly used may not scale well to tens of millions of cells and thousands of conditions, and consequently, there is a need to increase computational and algorithmic efciency. Tis is likely to involve various types of approximations and lossy compression to achieve the desired speed-up and reduction in memory footprint. An example is the use of strategies like mini-batch to speed up the estimation of k-means clustering [57] without compromising the quality of results.

Alongside improvements to existing analytical strategies, a wider reformulation of these methods to address new biological questions is needed to fully leverage datasets spanning tissues, species, and organismal age. One such example of an established method that requires novel frameworks to be applicable to new types of data is RNA velocity. A manifold-constrained and biologically tailored velocity, as opposed to general-purpose tools, could be designed to statistically compare estimates in the case–control setting [58, 59]. With such a modular method, a diseased or otherwise perturbed sample could be used to investigate whether subtle disruptions of the RNA velocity vectors indicate an efect of a particular perturbation.

Recently, there have been tremendous advances in AI, in particular in applications related to natural language processing, protein structure prediction, and image processing. What these methods have in common is that they rely on large datasets for training, and consequently cell atlases will help their advance. Several groups have developed foundation models leveraging the large-scale data collected via cell atlas eforts, e.g., Geneformer [60], scGPT [61], scFoundation [62], scBERT [63], CellFM [64], UCE [65], and atlas approximations [66]. Foundation models learn generalizable representations of cell type and state from gene expression profles, and they can be used to annotate new datasets, project them into shared latent spaces, infer missing modalities, and simulate responses to genetic or pharmacological perturbations. Despite these advances, widespread practical use remains limited. Current challenges include technical barriers to applying these models in user-friendly interfaces, dealing with memory and computational infrastructure requirements, limited interpretability and explainability of model predictions and representations, and the lack of widespread stress-testing of models on noisy, rare and disease-specifc single cell datasets to improve trust. Still, the feld is advancing rapidly, with several models already being applied to biologically meaningful tasks such as cross-species comparison [66, 67] and spatial pathology integration [68]. As tools become more accessible and validated, we anticipate that AI will increasingly serve as a bridge between cell atlases and translational insight.

## Using cell atlases for biomedical research

Perhaps the most important application underpinning eforts to build cell atlases is the notion that they can help accelerate biomedical research to help manage and cure disease [69, 70]. Below, we discuss some of the areas where cell atlases will provide key resources.

From large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), thousands of genetic loci have been identifed that infer risk of disease or infuence human traits. While these studies have yielded great and unexpected insights into complex and common diseases, they also reveal a yawning knowledge gap. For instance, for 50% of the risk loci identifed for coronary artery disease (CAD) it is unclear which gene(s) and which cell(s), and therefore which molecular and cellular pathways may be involved [71]. From studying CAD-associated loci, it is clear that gene regulatory efects are context-dependent, and that genetic efects can be condition-specifc in terms of efect, direction, and magnitude [72]. In other words, biological sex, environmental factors (e.g., smoking), and disease infuence genotypic efects and change cellular gene expression and responses. Te analysis of cell type and condition-specifc genetic efects on cellular molecular traits quantitative trait locus (molQTL) analysis will provide critical insights. Tese eforts could enable cell type and cell state-specifc colocalization of molQTL and GWAS signals to interpret the regulatory mechanisms for complex diseases and traits. Cell atlases that combine genetic information with cell molecular profles will be a key resource in unraveling such complex regulatory efects.

Cell atlases can also facilitate therapeutic target discovery, e.g., by predicting diseaserelevant cell states by identifying gene signatures along a trajectory from healthy to disease [73]. For example, muscle cells downregulate their contractile markers and become mesenchymal stem-like cells before adopting specialized cell states [74]. Tere are now automated pipelines (e.g., scDrug, Drug2Cell [75, 76]) that take as input a cell-by-gene matrix of protein-coding genes and leverage the full compendium of drug-gene interactions (e.g., DGIdb [77]), cell perturbations (e.g., LINCS L1000 [78]), FDA-approved molecules and biologics (e.g., DrugBank [79]), or active ligands (e.g., ChEMBL [80]) to prioritize potential drug target genes. Importantly, atlases could also be used to predict drug responses or unwanted side efects (e.g., scDR [81]) by querying identifed targets in public databases (e.g., SIDER [82]). Such a combination of cell atlas and therapeutic databases would enable the combination of genetic epidemiology, in particular, causal inference through Mendelian randomization, with single-cell biology, resulting in efective identifcation of druggable targets or surrogate markers of disease.

Te large collections of data presented in cell atlases require appropriate tools and frameworks that enable efcient exploration. Only in this way can they fulfll their potential in assisting a wide spectrum of researchers to generate novel hypotheses, faithfully representing the results, and communicating the fndings with the community. Several platforms and interfaces that aim to simplify the extraction of insight from such datasets have proliferated over the last decade, including, for example, the CELLxGENE tool [2], the Bioconductor iSEE package [83], Vitessce [84], and the browsers included in the Broad Single Cell Portal or the Single Cell Expression Atlas [85]. To illustrate how a typical user might interact with a cell atlas, a researcher interested in the expression of a fbroblast-associated gene (e.g., COL1A2) in tendons can flter by tissue, select relevant cell types, and visualize expression levels across conditions (healthy vs. after acute injury, [86]). Te spectrum of operations covered by such tools enables a powerful, in-depth exploration, possibly blending diferent views and representations of these large corpora of data, and linking out to other existing databases or relevant resources. For a more systematic guide to best practices in interacting with integrated atlases, we refer readers to the work of [87].

## Beyond atlases of dissociated single‑cell transcriptomes

Single-cell RNA-seq was the frst high-throughput method that allows for a high-plex characterization of individual cells, and thus it has been the most widely used approach [1, 88]. However, there are numerous other single-cell technologies under active development, and we foresee that over the coming years cell atlases will see an infux of other modalities [89]. Tese include TCR and BCR sequencing, ATAC-seq, and long-read sequencing. Although this is likely to be hugely benefcial to researchers, it also involves several diferent challenges. Tis starts with the organizations supporting the cell atlas, which must develop standards and protocols for how to process and curate other modalities [90]. Ensuring that diferent modalities can be combined for joint analyses is key, but it will present some major challenges, e.g., developing pre-processing pipelines, ontologies, and determining what metadata to include.

Several assays have been developed for measuring other aspects of the cellular state in single cells, e.g., DNA methylation, accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq), and transcription factor binding (scCUT&Tag), and an active area of research is to apply them to the same cell for multiomics profling. Tis will provide numerous opportunities, e.g., by combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, we are likely to improve our ability to infer gene regulatory networks [91]. However, integrating such data across tissues, donors, and platforms at the cell atlas scale presents substantial challenges. As multi-omics datasets become more complex and heterogeneous, future integration frameworks will need to account for missing modalities, difering noise characteristics, and scale. Recent reviews have highlighted methods based on shared latent spaces and graph-based integration as promising approaches for atlas-scale applications [92], while recent benchmarking eforts have examined the performance and scalability to sufciently large (atlas-scale) datasets [93].

Perhaps the most important direction of new technologies is toward spatial methods, primarily for transcriptomics and proteomics, but other modalities are likely to follow. Spatial data brings numerous challenges along with great potential for additional insights [94]. One challenge is in visualizing the data, and here, a user should be able to seamlessly toggle between gene expression space (typically a UMAP) and physical space. Tis representation is relatively straightforward for individual datasets, and indeed is implemented in cell atlas interfaces such as CxG, but for multiple samples it becomes much more challenging. For multiple samples, it may be more useful to map cells/spots to a common coordinate system, either informed by relative landmarks [95] or by merging across multiple samples [96]. Tere is also a need for further algorithmic development of methods, tools, and community standards for mining spatial data. Mining spatial data typically involves fnding subcellular patterns in cells associated with disease, type, and outcomes [97], as well as spatial patterns from histopathological image data that can then be used across archival histology data without the companion omics layers [98]. As technologies evolve and are able to profle larger tissue sections at subcellular resolution, a particular challenge will be to develop methods that can bridge molecular, cellular, and tissue-level patterns. Given the success of machine learning in image analysis, spatial omics is well positioned to beneft from cross-pollination with computer vision and AI techniques.

## Cell atlases outreach

At the moment, cell atlases are being built by scientists for other scientists [99]. However, given the potential implications to wider society and the substantial amounts of resources, much of which is coming from public funding, it is important that cell atlases can also cater to other audiences [99, 100]. Beyond the core constituency of academic biomedical researchers, potential users include clinicians and researchers in biotech and pharmaceutical industries. However, we believe that the ambition should be to make the resource at least somewhat accessible to the general public, including patients, teachers, and students of all ages [69]. Public-facing presentations of cell atlas resources should emphasize aspects that are relatable, visually intuitive, and grounded in relevance to human health. For example, simplifed representations of how cells function across organs, or how they change in common diseases, can be powerful tools for public engagement. Interactive visualizations, curriculum-aligned resources for educators, and narratives that link cellular biology to real-world medical advances (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, infection, or aging) are particularly valuable for broad audiences. Tis has the potential of helping to educate the public on the advances and benefts of biomedical research, involving citizen scientists, and inspiring the next generation of scientists to ensure that others will be able to build on the work. To maximize the accessibility and impact of these eforts, collaborations with science communication professionals can help ensure that messaging is accurate, inclusive, and engaging for non-specialist audiences.

## Conclusions and outlook

Here, we have outlined some of the challenges and opportunities brought along by cell atlases. We foresee that over the coming years, the existing atlases will continue to grow and that additional, more specialized collections will emerge. Having multiple atlases is likely to be benefcial to the feld as diferent policies for curation, representation, interaction, and use cases. One analogy is gene annotations, where resources such as Ensembl, Refseq, and Gencode continue to be used in parallel. Depending on the specifc need, one of these overlapping and complementary resources will be the most useful. In parallel, we expect substantial advances in computational methods that can efectively work with atlas-scale datasets to extract new insights.

Cell atlases have been enabled by technological advances, and we envision that continued innovation will govern how cell atlases evolve. As costs fall, we also expect that atlases will be broadened. To realize the potential not just for biomedical research, but for other aspects of biology, we need better coverage of human populations across the age spectra and for multiple disease states. Moreover, additional species are needed. Most likely, within the next few years, advancements in the felds of proteomics and metabolomics will enable the profling of large numbers of single cells via these modalities, unlocking more accurate modeling of metabolism, signaling, and cell–cell communication.

In addition to their biomedical applications, cell atlases are proving to be invaluable resources for fundamental research in developmental biology, comparative genomics, and evolutionary biology. Developmental atlases, such as those of the human fetus [101], human brain [102], zebrafsh [103], fruit fy [104], and mouse [105], provide rich datasets for understanding cell fate decisions and lineage specifcation, both in humans and in an evolutionary context (“evo-devo”) [106]. Comparative atlases across species, including non-model mammals, birds, and reptiles [107], as well as plant atlases [108, 109], enable insights into conserved and divergent cellular programs. Resources like SPEED [110] and the Malaria Cell Atlas [111] further extend atlas applications into ecology and parasite biology. Together, these resources demonstrate that cell atlases are not only tools for biomedical discovery but are also essential for addressing fundamental questions in cell and developmental biology, evolution, and organismal diversity.

Te availability of large-scale data resources contributes to the democratization of science. In fact, we have reached a point where many projects are run using only public data. Single-cell data is information dense, and there is little chance that the lab that generated the data has the capacity to make all the discoveries that are possible, in particular those that are only possible by combining with other datasets. Enabling the efcient use and reuse of complex and multiple datasets allows our scientifc community to increase the pace of scientifc discoveries.

In summary, we have described the development and utilization of cell atlases, which are comprehensive maps of cell types and states generated through the integration of large volumes of single-cell data. We detailed challenges and opportunities in building, maintaining, and utilizing these atlases (Fig.  2), emphasizing the importance of data standardization, accessibility, and computational tools for extracting meaningful biological insights, ultimately aiming to facilitate cross-tissue, cross-condition, and cross-species studies in the feld of single-cell biology.

## Figure Descriptions

**Figure 1.** Cell atlases ingest data from a wide range of labs based on specifc criteria, e.g., species, disease, and tissue. Data is processed in a coherent manner and made available through a portal. The portal enables a wide range of queries to either download or interrogate multiple datasets. On their own or in combination with additional experiments, these queries can result in new fndings
